1. WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC AREA (180 TO MALAY PENINSULA):
   A. TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY: NONE.
   B. TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SUMMARY:
      (1) THE AREA OF CONVECTION (INVEST 95W) PREVIOUSLY LOCATED NEAR 
21.8N 132.0E IS NOW LOCATED NEAR 24.2N 132.5E, APPROXIMATELY 288 NM 
EAST-SOUTHEAST OF KADENA, JAPAN. ANIMATED MULTISPECTRAL SATELLITE 
IMAGERY (MSI) DEPICTS A BROAD LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION (LLC) WITH WEAK 
FLARING CONVECTION. A 022147Z WSFM 89GHZ MICROWAVE IMAGE REVEALS A 
WEAKLY DEFINED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION (LLC) WITH DISORGANIZED 
CONVECTION. A 030121Z ASCAT-C PASS SHOWS A WEAK CIRCULATION EMBEDDED 
WITHING A BROADER CIRCULATION ADJACENT TO AN EXTENSIVE SWATH OF 
SOUTHERLY GRADIENT WINDS OF 25-30 KNOTS. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS REVEALS 
A FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH LOW VERTICAL WIND SHEAR OF 
10-15 KNOTS, DUAL-CHANNEL OUTFLOW, AND WARM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES OF 
29-30C. DETERMINISTIC AND ENSEMBLE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
INDICATING SLOW INTENSIFICATION, WITH MAX WINDS OF 25-30 KNOTS OVER THE 
EASTERN SEMI-CIRCLE AND A NORTHWARD TRACK TOWARDS KYUSHU OVER THE NEXT 
24-36 HOURS. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS ARE ESTIMATED AT 20 TO 25 
KNOTS. MINIMUM SEA LEVEL PRESSURE IS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 1004 MB. THE 
POTENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT TROPICAL CYCLONE WITHIN 
THE NEXT 24 HOURS REMAINS HIGH. SEE REF A (WTPN21 PGTW 021500) FOR 
FURTHER DETAILS.
      (2) NO OTHER SUSPECT AREAS.
   C. SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM SUMMARY: NONE.
2. SOUTH PACIFIC AREA (WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA TO 135 EAST):
   A. TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY: NONE.
   B. TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SUMMARY: NONE.
   C. SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM SUMMARY: NONE.//

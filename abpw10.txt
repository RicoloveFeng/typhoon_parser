1. WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC AREA (180 TO MALAY PENINSULA):
   A. TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY: NONE.
   B. TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SUMMARY:
      (1) THE AREA OF CONVECTION (INVEST 95W) PREVIOUSLY LOCATED NEAR 
19.9N 131.8E IS NOW LOCATED NEAR 21.8N 132.0E, APPROXIMATELY 356 NM 
SOUTHEAST OF KADENA, JAPAN. ANIMATED ENHANCED INFRARED SATELLITE 
IMAGERY DEPICTS A BROAD LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION WITH PERSISTENT 
CONVECTION. A 021252Z ASCAT-C IMAGE SHOWS A CLOSED CIRCULATION HAS 
FORMED BELOW THE PERSISTENT CONVECTION ADJACENT TO A SWATH OF 25-30 
KNOT GRADIENT WINDS. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS REVEALS A MARGINALLY 
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH LOW TO MODERATE VERTICAL 
WIND SHEAR (VWS) OF 15-20 KNOTS, DUAL-CHANNEL UPPER-LEVEL OUTFLOW, AND 
WARM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES (SST) OF 29-30 C. DETERMINISTIC MODELS 
SHOW SLOW INTENSIFICATION OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS, WITH A NORTHWARD 
TRACK TOWARD WESTERN JAPAN. THE GEFS AND ECENS ENSEMBLES ALSO SUPPORT A 
NORTHWARD TRACK TOWARD KYUSHU OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED 
SURFACE WINDS ARE ESTIMATED AT 20 TO 25 KNOTS. MINIMUM SEA LEVEL 
PRESSURE IS ESTIMATED TO BE NEAR 1005 MB. THE POTENTIAL FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT TROPICAL CYCLONE WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS 
IS UPGRADED TO HIGH. SEE REF A (WTPN21 PGTW 021500) FOR FURTHER 
DETAILS.
      (2) NO OTHER SUSPECT AREAS.
   C. SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM SUMMARY: NONE.
2. SOUTH PACIFIC AREA (WEST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA TO 135 EAST):
   A. TROPICAL CYCLONE SUMMARY: NONE.
   B. TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SUMMARY: NONE.
   C. SUBTROPICAL SYSTEM SUMMARY: NONE.
3. JUSTIFICATION FOR REISSUE: UPGRADED AREA IN PARA. 1.B.(1) TO HIGH.//
